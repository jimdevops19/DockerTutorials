### Structure:
 - All - This is a folder with all the projects (each subfolder represents a video), **before** my additions during the video, so in order to follow along with my tutorials, use this folder.
 - EndOfTutorial - A folder with all the projects (each subfolder represents a video), **after** my additions during the video.
